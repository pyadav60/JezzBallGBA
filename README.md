# JezzBallGBA
Just as it sounds, this is a remake of JezzBall for the Gameboy Advance.

## How to run
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this game.
I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class.
I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM.
If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can!
This has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the ROM file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!
